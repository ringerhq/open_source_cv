# Ringer Open Source CV

This is an Open Source version of our Open Source CV. It is not perfectly in line with the one found at [ringerhq.com](https://www.ringerhq.com) as we rely on some internal data to generate the one on the Ringer Site. We will continue to update and improve this version.

This is designed to give you a starting point to build your own Open Source CV to integrate into your own site.

## To Use

- Update the Username in App.vue
- Update the PAT in github.js
